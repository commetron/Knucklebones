# How to Play
- Take turns with the ai to place dices on a 3x3 board. 
- Same dices in a column will have their values multiplied. 
- If you place a dice in a column where the opponent already has a same dice, the opponent will lose the dice. 
- The game ends when one of the boards are full. 
- The player with the highest score wins.
